# What other examples are there of abstractions in Computer Science?
* Computers= there are a lot of aspects but we only use/see the physical system
* Programs= not many people look at the code that helps run it
* Face ID= the process of designing and making face recognition was complex but using it is easy
* Peripherals= e.g. printers, mouse, keyboards
* Bluetooth
