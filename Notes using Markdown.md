# Limitations of Physical Measurements

Error=difference between an individual result and the true value
Uncertainty=estimate of the range of values within which the true value lies for a measurement

## Measurement Model in practice
Normally, the model always has a positive error
In practice we know that the error could make our observed value look larger or smaller than the true value 
e.g. measuring the temperature
* To show our uncertainty, we might say that the temperature is 95 ± 3oC.
* This means our true value is likely to be between 92oC and 98oC.


## Systematic error
Systematic errors affect accuracy and occur due to the apparatus or faults in the experimental method. Systematic errors cause all results to be too high or too low by the same amount each time. An example is a balance that isn’t zeroed correctly (zero error) or reading a scale at a different angle (this is a parallax error). 
* Zero Error: an error that occurs when the apparatus shows a non-zero value when it should be registering a value of exactly zero. 
* Parallax Error: an error produced whenever a scale, gauge, or pointer is observed wrongly during scientific experimentation due to position of viewing and perception.
### To reduce systematic error: 
Calibrate apparatus by measuring a known value (e.g. weigh 1 kg on a mass balance), if the reading is inaccurate then the systematic error is easily identified. 
In radiation experiments correct for background radiation by measuring it beforehand and excluding it from final results. 
Read the meniscus (the central curve on the surface of a liquid) at eye level (to reduce parallax error) and use controls in experiments. 

## Random Error

A random error is an experimental error caused by unknown or unpredictable changes to the apparatus or conditions or due to reading the measuring equipment in different ways.  Random errors affect precision, meaning they cause differences in measurements which causes a spread about the mean and don’t follow a set pattern unlike systematic errors.  You cannot get rid of all random errors. An example of random error is electronic noise in the circuit of an electrical instrument 
Random errors can be reduced, by improving techniques, making multiple measurements or using instruments with a higher degree of precision. This increases precision.
* e.g.
 1. Take at least 3 repeats and calculate a mean, this method also allows anomalies to be identified. If there was no systematic error, we assume that the observed value we get after lots of repeats is the true value.If an experiment was carried out a large number of times, we would expect to see these random errors mostly cancel each other out.
 1. Use computers/data loggers/cameras to reduce human error and enable smaller intervals.
 1. Use appropriate equipment, e.g a micrometer has higher resolution (0.1 mm) than a ruler (1 mm). 

## Describing Measurements:
Resolution= The smallest change in a quantity that an instrument can measure. The higher the resolution, the higher the precision in repeat readings.
The smallest change in the quantity being measured that gives a recognisable change in reading 
Accuracy= An experiment is accurate if the quantity being measured has a value that’s very close to the commonly accepted or true value. For example an experimental value for the acceleration of free fall of 9.78 m s-2 is much more accurate than an experimental value of 9.05 m s-2 . 


Precision= The results of an experiment are precise if they are close together and have a small range. The smaller the range of the repeated values, the higher the precision. The term precision is linked to the spread of the data or the percentage uncertainty in a measurement. A precise experiment has a smaller spread in the data or the smaller the uncertainty. Hence, an experiment with an acceleration of free fall of (9.05 ± 0.05) ms-2 is much more precise than an experiment with (9.78 ± 1.20) ms-2 ; but the latter is much more accurate.
Precise measurements are consistent, they fluctuate slightly about a mean value - this doesn’t indicate the value is accurate
Repeatability= If the original experimenter can redo the experiment with the same equipment and method then get the same results it is repeatable
Reproducibility= If the experiment is redone by a different person or with different techniques and equipment and the same results are found, it is reproducible


If a measurement or test is reliable, it gives consistent results each time the activity is repeated. A reliable experiment has consistent results for the same measurement. Experiments are unreliable if repeated measurements give different results or if the scatter of measurements on a line graph is large (or so great that establishing a line of best fit is difficult).
